## What is Train Adventure?

This app uses the live API from the Belgian railways to show you where you could end up from any given start.

This is how you use it:

1. At the start, you are greeted by a start screen, which again explains these steps (Dutch only).

2. As soon as you click start, you are taken to a page where you can choose your starting station.

3. After selecting your starting station, the app will show you the 'departures' board.

4. This board shows you all trains leaving from your current station by their 'terminus'.

5. When you select the direction you want to head in, you basically board the train and are given a list of the different stops on your route.

6. Select the station where you want to exit the train, and there you'll be seeing that station's 'departures' board.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 to keep travelling between over 650 stations where Belgian trains end up :)
